# Airbnb_Project
Project for merging multiple Excel files and doing calculations.
This project was made withing the context of the lesson "e-commerce & e-business", 
aiming at the merging of multiple Excel files for future data analysis. 
Specifically, it merges multiple sheets from one directory, for the years 2013-2017, 
which contain the number of clicks-searches using the Airbnb service, at different cities across the world. 
Furthermore, due to the change of the months, using the reduction method,
it calculates the number of searches that belong to two different months, 
and also it calculates a summary of the searches at the end of each month. 
The resulting file is stored as a new Excel file.
